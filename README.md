# My-Simon-Game
A web-based implementation of the Simon Game built utilizing jQuery.  Completed as part of The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy.

The Simon Game is a multi-level electronic game that tests the memory of players by displaying a sequence of lights and then requiring users to repeat that exact sequence.  As the users progresses through the various levels,
the sequences become longer.  This is a web-based implementation of the game.  The game utilizes a random generator in Javascript to create a sequence of lights.  The code leverages callback functions in jQuery to verify the pattern selected by the user matches the randomly generated pattern.
